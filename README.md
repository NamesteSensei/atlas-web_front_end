## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **structural aspect** of a webpage using HTML5. No CSS or JavaScript is involved at this stageâ€”our primary goal is to create a well-structured, semantic HTML page that follows best practices.

The website created in this project is for a fictional digital agency called **Techium**. Over the course of this project, you will learn how to structure a website with semantic HTML tags like `header`, `main`, `footer`, `nav`, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand and apply HTML5 standards.
- Use semantic HTML elements to structure a webpage.
- Create a valid HTML5 document skeleton.
- Differentiate between `div` and `span` tags.
- Use headings in a hierarchical manner (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.).
- Understand the importance of metadata in the `<head>` section.
- Embed multimedia elements such as images, videos, and audio in an HTML page.
- Structure data using HTML tables.
- Handle links, lists, and embedded external content (e.g., `iframe`).

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **vi** (or **vim**): For editing HTML files in the terminal.
